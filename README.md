## About

The portfolio portion of the site was built with different sections of the SPA in mind.  Each section has a dedicated component with various other subcomponents nested inside.  Most of the UI for the site has been compartmentalized into individual UI components for reusability.  As there wasn't a need for a big backend for this project, I just simply organized the project data into two separate javascript object files.  The "Projects" section of this site pulls data from these two files to populate the site with info about my projects.
