This is my personal portfolio website / blog.  Feel free to poke around and see how it was built!

## Built with Next.js

This project was built with Next.js, a tiny bit of react-reveal, and mostly just code from scratch.  

## Organization

The portfolio portion of the site was built with different sections of the SPA in mind.  Each section has a dedicated component with various other subcomponents nested inside.  Most of the UI for the site has been compartmentalized into individual UI components for reusability.  As there wasn't a need for a big backend for this project, I just simply organized the project data into two separate javascript object files.  The "Projects" section of this site pulls data from these two files to populate the site with info about my projects.

## Visit the site

The site is deployed and served by Vercel and can be visited here: (https://devcho.com)
